## Overview

Dragon-Presence Discord RPC is a custom Roblox Rich Presence (RPC) solution for Discord, enabling you to share your Roblox game activity on your Discord profile. What distinguishes this RPC is its utilization of a website-based method, eliminating the need for access to sensitive Roblox information such as cookies.

This README offers comprehensive instructions on setting up and utilizing Dragon-Presence Discord RPC.

## Features

- Showcase your current Roblox game activity on your Discord profile.
- Safeguard your privacy by avoiding the need for sensitive Roblox data like cookies.
- Seamlessly integrate with Discord through a user-friendly website-based solution.
- **Auto-launch Control:** You can now toggle the auto-launch feature for the application, ensuring it starts automatically when your system boots up. This provides greater control and convenience over the application's behavior.
- **Improved User Interaction:** The application now prompts users in a more user-friendly and formal manner, making it easier to understand and interact with the auto-launch feature.
